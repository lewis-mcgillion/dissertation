Abstract:

This project aimed to accurately predict the average speed, head-to-head wins and
overall wins of Tour de France stages using machine learning. Six regression and five
classification models were employed. Artificial Neural Network produced the most
accurate predictions, predicting the average speeds of stages with a mean absolute
error of 2.43 and predicted head-to-head wins with an accuracy of 74.28%. However,
none of the models could predict the winners of stages with an accuracy of more
than 20% due to the limitations of the dataset. More accurate predictions may be
achieved by obtaining more detailed data on the stage terrain and including results
of other races, not just the Tour de France.
